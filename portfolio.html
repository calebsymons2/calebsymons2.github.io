        <div class="description">Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Todd Semonite retired in September 2020 after more than four years as commanding general of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, during which he led efforts to rebuild infrastructure after several devastating hurricanes, construct President Trump's controversial border wall and establish emergency medical facilities following the COVID-19 outbreak. I spoke with the Bellows Falls, Vt. native about his legacy later that month. </div>

        <div class="description">Hundred Nights Inc., a shelter and resource center for people experiencing homelessness in Keene, N.H., is eligible to apply for federal funding that homeless shelters can use to improve social distancing among their guests. I wrote about how city land use regulations, which are slated for revision in 2021, are limiting Hundred Nights' ability to apply for the emergency funding. </div>

A draft NEPA review for the project did not identify monarch butterflies among its survey “for the presence of federally listed or proposed, threatened, or endangered species," despite their alleged presence in the area. </div>

        <div class="description">I spoke with Rebecca Crowell, who was furloughed from her health care job in March and received the $600-per-week federal pandemic unemployment relief (FPUC) as well as $188 in weekly unemployment benefits from the state, about the importance of the FPUC assistance for her family. Housing experts in New Hampshire and the Monadnock region told me that Crowell's family is one of many that will likely struggle to afford rent payments, groceries and other expenses when the federal relief program expires at the end of July. </div>

        <div class="description">I documented the Tufts administration’s response to the first case of COVID-19 in the community, which revealed a lack of coordination among state, local and university officials over how to handle cases during the early days of the pandemic. Administrators waited more than two days after learning of the potential case to begin contacting students who may have been exposed to the virus.</div>

        <div class="description">Following the university’s decision to close on-campus residences for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester, I detailed the process by which students could apply for temporary housing extensions. Students were considered if they lived in a country designated by the CDC with a Level 3 travel warning, if restrictions in place at the time would impact their travel or if they demonstrated extenuating financial or personal circumstances. Of the 590 extension applications, Tufts granted 301.</div>

        <div class="description">Shortly before canceling in-person classes for the remainder of the semester, the Tufts administration announced a series of travel restrictions for university faculty, staff and students aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Administrators also warned faculty to prepare for a scenario in which they would have to teach remotely.

        <div class="description">I spoke with members of the Tufts Elections Commission (ECOM) about their use of the Voatz election application to conduct student government elections after MIT researchers found security vulnerabilities in the software. ECOM pledged to re-evaluate its relationship with Voatz, given the security concerns and that voting through the company’s web portal was unavailable to Tufts students in a February special election.</div>

        <div class="description">Tufts’ International Center contacted 40 students from the six countries slated to be added to the Trump administration’s travel ban in February 2020 in order to explain the updated ban’s provisions. I detailed those provisions, which do not restrict entry for people on non-immigrant visas, such as students, and spoke with a Tanzanian student about his concerns with the restrictions.

        <div class="description">The Somerville City Council approved a 552-page zoning ordinance in December 2019 after nearly eight years of committee meetings, public hearings and analysis by city officials. The new code expanded affordable housing requirements for new developments, sought to prevent congestion and established innovative environmental standards.

        <div class="description">I analyzed former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Donald Stern’s report on Tufts’ relationship with the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the developer of oxycontin, following its release in December 2019. The report found no clear violations of Tufts’ conflict-of-interest policies but revealed that the Sacklers and Purdue used repeated donations to gain influence and bolster their reputations through faculty hiring decisions, curricula oversight and honorary degrees.

        <div class="description">Working with several reporters to analyze Federal Election Commission data, I found that Tufts faculty members contributed $1.5 million to political organizations between January 2015 and September 2019. Of that sum, which comprised 17,000 unique donations, 94 percent went to Democratic candidates and progressive causes.
