      <div class="description">On March 12, an undergraduate student at Tufts became the first member of the university community to test positive for COVID-19. I spoke with the student about the days leading up to the positive diagnosis, as well as their time in quarantine, for an as-told-to story in the Boston Globe Magazine.</div>

      <div class="description">I documented the Tufts administration’s response to the first case of COVID-19 in the community, which revealed a lack of coordination among state, local and university officials over how to handle cases during the early days of the pandemic. Administrators waited more than two days after learning of the potential case to begin contacting students who may have been exposed to the virus.</div>

      <div class="description">Tufts canceled the program through which it hosts foreign exchange students as part of its response to the coronavirus pandemic. This left exchange students scrambling to secure flights to their home countries, many of which were under lockdown regulations at the time, before their J-1 visas expired.</div>

      <div class="description">Following the university’s decision to close on-campus residences for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester, I detailed the process by which students could apply for temporary housing extensions. Students were considered if they lived in a country designated by the CDC with a Level 3 travel warning, if restrictions in place at the time would impact their travel or if they demonstrated extenuating financial or personal circumstances. Of the 590 extension applications, Tufts granted 301.</div>

      <div class="description">I reported the breaking news that an undergraduate student at Tufts had tested positive for COVID-19. Another <i>Daily</i> reporter and I had identified the student through a source before the positive test was announced, and we were thus able to speak with him when the news broke.</div>

    <div class="description">Shortly before canceling in-person classes for the remainder of the semester, the Tufts administration announced a series of travel restrictions for university faculty, staff and students aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. Administrators also warned faculty to prepare for a scenario in which they would have to teach remotely.

    <div class="description">I spoke with members of the Tufts Elections Commission (ECOM) about their use of the Voatz election application to conduct student government elections after MIT researchers found security vulnerabilities in the software. ECOM pledged to re-evaluate its relationship with Voatz, given the security concerns and that voting through the company’s web portal was unavailable to Tufts students in a February special election.</div>

    <div class="description">Tufts’ International Center contacted 40 students from the six countries slated to be added to the Trump administration’s travel ban in February 2020 in order to explain the updated ban’s provisions. I detailed those provisions, which do not restrict entry for people on non-immigrant visas, such as students, and spoke with a Tanzanian student about his concerns with the restrictions.

    <div class="description">The Somerville City Council approved a 552-page zoning ordinance in December 2019 after nearly eight years of committee meetings, public hearings and analysis by city officials. The new code expanded affordable housing requirements for new developments, sought to prevent congestion and established innovative environmental standards.

    <div class="description">I analyzed former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts Donald Stern’s report on Tufts’ relationship with the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma, the developer of oxycontin, following its release in December 2019. The report found no clear violations of Tufts’ conflict-of-interest policies but revealed that the Sacklers and Purdue used repeated donations to gain influence and bolster their reputations through faculty hiring decisions, curricula oversight and honorary degrees.

    <div class="description">Working with several reporters to analyze Federal Election Commission data, I found that Tufts faculty members contributed $1.5 million to political organizations between January 2015 and September 2019. Of that sum, which comprised 17,000 unique donations, 94 percent went to Democratic candidates and progressive causes.
