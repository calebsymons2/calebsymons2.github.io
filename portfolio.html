        <div class="description">After Koffee Kup Bakery in Vermont abruptly closed, many of the 500 people laid off reported that they hadn't received their unused PTO, which amounted to $800,000 across the entire company. That stemmed from a dispute between Koffee Kup's owner and a court-appointed receiver managing the bakery's assets, with both denying responsibility for that pay. One worker told me, "I just wanted what was due to me. They kicked us again when we were down.” </div>

        <div class="description">In a series of stories, I spoke with residents of the Walden Eco-Village, a sustainable-living community in Peterborough, who were given five days' notice to vacate their homes due to code and zoning violations that town officials said posted an "immediate danger" to them. The tenants, all of whom rented from the same landlord, were upset about leaving on such short notice. Some blamed the town for what they saw as a heartless and dangerous decision; others criticized the landlord for not properly permitting their homes. </div>
