    <p>I'm an award-winning reporter for <i>Law360</i>, covering cybersecurity, consumer protection, international arbitration and Native American law. I previously reported on government, public safety and housing for the <i>Keene Sentinel</i> in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire and have also published stories in a wide range of styles, from breaking news to longform investigative journalism. I also offer freelance communuications services, having coordinated media coverage for the American Amputee Soccer Association as Team USA prepared for the 2022 World Cup in Istanbul, Turkey./p>
    <p>I graduated <i>summa cum laude</i> from Tufts University in May 2020 with a B.A. in political science and international relations. I served as managing editor of the school's independent student newspaper, the <i>Tufts Daily</i>, in Fall 2018 and later as its executive investigative editor. While at Tufts, I developed an interest in political reporting during internships in the U.S. Senate and the Massachusetts State Senate.</p>
